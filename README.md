COMBO ANSWER:<br>

_"I'm not comfortable sharing my current salary. I would prefer to focus on the value I can add to this company rather than what I’m paid at my current job. I don’t have a specific number in mind for a desired salary, and you know better than I do what value my skills and experience could bring to your company. I want this move to be a big step forward for me in terms of both responsibility and compensation."_


**don't let them trick you into answering. always make them put the first number on the table.**

External recruiter vs internal recruiter: I **can** give a number to an **external** recruiter.  Because their commission is based on my salary, so you can take the position that you and the recruiter are working together to get you the best salary.

### From that article: **compare negotiating positions**
<p>

#### Three unique pieces of information you have:

* Your current salary
* Your expected salary
* How badly you need or want the job
That’s basically all of the unique information you have.

Let’s compare that to the unique pieces of information the company has:

* The salary range for the position
* The overall compensation budget available
* How many of these positions they’re trying to fill
* How long they’ve been trying to fill the position
* How badly they need to fill the position
* How many other candidates they have to consider for the job
* How much they like you for the position relative to those candidates

**Try asking them for those pieces of info before you answer their questions :)**
